# SPA Website Version 1

This Single Page Application has been made based on [this](https://youtu.be/OFKBep95lb4?si=P7r2k4GczjP8byiF)
tutorial, but with the following changes:
    - I apply relative measurements (rem instead of px) which basically allows us to have a better responsive web design.
    - I reduce redundant code, specially when specifying margins, paddings because it is usually applied with the all possible values (top, right, bottom and left).
    - I changed the color palette and also I used variables to store their values so it's easy to change the theme itself.
    - I've made some changes, for example, in mobile view, you can see a "sticky" tittle in the services and projects section.
